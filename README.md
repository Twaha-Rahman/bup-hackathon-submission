# GridWise — Smart Campus Energy Optimization (Go)

LLM-assisted energy scheduling service built for the *BUP CSE Fest 2026 Hackathon*, Online Preliminary (GridWise challenge).

Written entirely in Go using only the standard library. No web frameworks, no external solver packages.

* *Live Endpoint:* [http://20.196.201.41]
* *Repository:* [github.com/Twaha-Rahman/bup-hackathon-submission](https://github.com/Twaha-Rahman/bup-hackathon-submission?utm_source=gemini)

## Architecture Overview

text
POST /optimize-energy
  │  controller: request validation (400 / 422)
  ▼
  LLM interpretation  — OpenRouter, single call, one entry per note
  │  output treated as untrusted JSON
  ▼
  deterministic guardrails — count, type, hours, numbers, applies semantics
  │  anything invalid degrades to no_op; never invented, never a crash
  ▼
  optimizer — exact dynamic programming over (hour × battery level)
  ▼
  independent replay validator → totals recomputed from the plan → 200


The language model is used for one job only: turning operator notes into directive_interpretation. It is never used just for summary text. Every number in the schedule — effective solar, reserves, charge and discharge windows, grid caps, battery physics, end-of-day neutrality, totals — comes from deterministic code.

If the model is unreachable or returns unusable output, all notes degrade safely to no_op and the service still returns a valid schedule.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your development machine:

* *Go* (v1.22 or newer)
* *Docker* (optional, for containerized execution)

---

## Environment Configuration

Copy the example environment file and configure your API key:

cp .env.example .env


## Running for Development

1. Clone the repository and navigate into the directory:

git clone https://github.com/Twaha-Rahman/bup-hackathon-submission
cd bup-hackathon-submission


2. Run the server directly:

go run .


The server binds to 0.0.0.0:$PORT (default 3000). Verify it is up:

curl -s http://localhost:3000/health
# {"status":"ok"}


Alternatively, build a standalone binary:

go build -o server .
./server


---

## Docker Fallback

You can run the application containerized using Docker:

# Build the Docker image
docker build -t gridwise .

# Run the container
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env --name gridwise-container gridwise

# Verify health
curl -s http://localhost:3000/health


**Note:** The image exposes port `3000`, binds to `0.0.0.0`, and contains no baked-in credentials. Pass the key at run time with `--env-file`.

## Configuration Reference

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OPENROUTER_API_KEY | *Yes* | OpenRouter API key for live interpretation |
| PORT | No (default 3000) | Server listen port |

* *Model and Provider:* OpenRouter deepseek/deepseek-v4.1-flash, reasoning enabled, pinned to open-inference/fp8, no provider fallbacks. Called over the OpenAI-compatible POST /api/v1/chat/completions endpoint with response_format: json_object and temperature: 0.0.
* *Caching:* Interpretations are cached (TTL 300s success, 60s failure, 100 keys).

**Important Conventions:**
* A window from **1 PM to 3 PM** corresponds to hours `[13, 14]` (start included, end excluded).
* For `solar_reduction`, the `factor` represents the remaining fraction (e.g., an 80% reduction means a factor of `0.2`).

## Validation Behavior & Error Handling

| Condition | Status Code | Response Structure / Error |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Malformed JSON body | 400 | {"error":"Malformed JSON body."} |
| Missing or non-string scenario_id | 400 | Standard error payload |
| operator_notes not an array | 400 | Standard error payload |
| operator_notes wrong count or empty entries | 422 | Standard error payload |
| Hours not exactly 24 unique hours (0–23) | 400 | Standard error payload |
| Negative or non-finite numbers | 422 | Standard error payload |
| Battery missing fields | 400 | Standard error payload |
| Incoherent battery levels (min > initial, initial > capacity, etc.) | 422 | Standard error payload |
| Internal server panic | 500 | {"scenario_id": ..., "error":"Internal server processing failure."} |

No secrets or stack traces appear in any response. The API key always travels in a secure header, never in a URL.

## Public-Sample Test Procedure

The 10 worked cases are located in instructions/BUP_CSE_FEST_2026_Preli_Public_Sample_Cases.json, each containing input, expected output, and rationale.

With the local server running, execute the verification script:

python3 - <<'EOF'
import json, urllib.request
pack = json.load(open('instructions/BUP_CSE_FEST_2026_Preli_Public_Sample_Cases.json'))
for c in pack['cases']:
    req = json.dumps(c['input']).encode()
    r = urllib.request.Request('http://localhost:3000/optimize-energy',
        data=req, headers={'Content-Type': 'application/json'})
    out = json.load(urllib.request.urlopen(r, timeout=60))
    exp = c['expected_output']
    got  = [(e['directive_type'], e['applies']) for e in out['directive_interpretation']]
    want = [(e['directive_type'], e['applies']) for e in exp['directive_interpretation']]
    print(c['id'], 'interp_match=', got == want,
          'cost=%.1f ref=%.1f' % (out['total_cost_bdt'], exp['total_cost_bdt']))
EOF


Expected Result: Interpretation semantics match on every case, and total_cost_bdt equals the reference optimal cost. Equivalent optima are accepted by the judge; exact equality is what the local DP solver reaches.

## Limitations & Security

* *Quantization:* The DP solver quantizes battery energy at 0.5 kWh, with a 0.25 kWh fallback. Scenarios with finer granularity in initial_energy_kwh may be rejected rather than scheduled.
* *Rate Limits:* Free-tier LLM quota applies. Under sustained 429 or 503 responses, the service returns valid all-`no_op` schedules (validity is preserved, but interpretation credit for those notes is lost). One bounded retry is attempted per request.
* *Infeasibility:* Infeasible scenarios featuring contradictory hard directives — which organizers exclude from scoring — return controlled 500 errors.
* *Secrets Management:* Keys live exclusively in a local .env file, which is git-ignored and never committed, logged, or returned in any response. The Docker image contains zero hardcoded credentials.
